# Personal Site
This site was made using the Uikit framework https://getuikit.com/
<br>I wanted to go with a more minimalistic design and this framework went so well with my overall design. 

So far my projects page is still a work in progress, and my contacts page needs some PHP and MySQL to have
the message loop back to my email.
