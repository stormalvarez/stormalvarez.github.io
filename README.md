# Personal Site
This site was made using the Uikit framework https://getuikit.com/
<br>I wanted to go with a more minimalistic design and this framework went so well with my overall design. 

So far my projects page is still a work in progress, as I plan on making a few more changes to it. Overall
however, this is how far I have come in HTML and CSS.
